## Research interests
During my undergraduate studies I was part of a soil quality project research project for Tequila quality and have helped mapping new species observation in Jalisco, Mexico. <br> I am very interested in water quality and management as well. For now, I'd like to be part of project for conservation and/or restoration of natural resources and biodiversity.
